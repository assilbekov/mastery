# Mastery

This is my pet project to track time on practicing skills.

## What is this repository?

**Mastery** is open source product. I used T3 stack - tailwind, typescript, tRPC.

## How to use the actual product? 

Click to the [project link](https://mastery-red.vercel.app/). I used Clerk for simple authentication, drizzle for ORM and Postgres for DB and Vercel to deploy.
